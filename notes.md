I want you to split this project in twain. This is a presentation that changed midway through.
I want you to make a new dir called `clauding`
Copy most off the entire project over to this new dir. Except a few special considerations:

- Don't copy slides.md, but make a new slides.md in `clauding`
- Break off slides.md, in root, from line 1459 onwards and add that to the new slides.md in `clauding`
- Move ZenGarden.vue to the new dir(remove from root project)
- Also move LoadingBar.vue
