  <h3>The FluidMagic Transformation</h3>
  <p class="mt-2">From 2021 to 2025, we transformed FluidMagic into a more maintainable codebase</p>
  <p class="text-sm opacity-70 mt-2">Less code, better test coverage, reduced complexity</p>
</div>

<!--
This slide shows how the codebase has evolved over the FluidMagic project lifecycle:

- We started with a massive 90K+ lines of code in late 2021
- Through strategic refactoring, we've reduced the codebase size by 28% while adding features
- Test coverage increased dramatically from 15% to 85%
- Code complexity (measured by cyclomatic complexity) was reduced by 29%

The interactive chart allows you to hover over specific points in time to see the exact metrics.
